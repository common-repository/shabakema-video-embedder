== Description ==
It lets you embed videos from [ShabakeMa.com](http://shabakema.com) via [shabakema] shortcode. Let your sites load faster with Lazyload mode (Because shabakema supports native thumbnails). Clean and easy shortcode syntax.

You can adjust the size of the video player by changing the values of 'width and 'height' parameters in the shortcode. The following code will create a player that has a custom width and height.
